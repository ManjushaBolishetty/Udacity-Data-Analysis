    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image demonstrates both conditions. The first line shows the congruent words condition. The second line shows the incongruent words condition.\n",

    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will be measuring the time in seconds it takes to name ink colors in equally sized lists for each participant in the two conditions. Our independent variable is the type of condition applied to the student, either the congruent condition or the incongruent condition. Our dependent variable is the time in seconds that it takes for the participant to name the ink colors in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to determine if the effect between the two conditions (congruent and incongruent) is statistically significant. Therefore we will take the following as our hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "H_0:\\mu_a - \\mu_0 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "H_a:\\mu_a - \\mu_0 \\neq 0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_0$ is the mean of the congruent condition and $\\mu_a$ is the mean of the incongruent condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze our hypothesis we will use a paired t-test. Each participant will perform under two conditions, the congruent condition and incongruent condition. Although we have an intuitive sense that the effect will cause increased times for the incongruent condition group, we will use a two tailed test in case our intuition is incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following $\\alpha$ to determine statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\alpha = .05\n",
