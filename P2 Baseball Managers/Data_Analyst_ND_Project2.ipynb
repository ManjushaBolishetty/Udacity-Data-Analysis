    "### Introduction\n",
    "Major League Baseball (MLB) is known for its all-stars making multi million dollar salaries and hitting towering homeruns. Often overlooked is the manager, who rarely leaves the duggout except to argue with an umpire, throw his hat, and get ejected from the game. Behind the scenes there are many decisions being made by the manager every pitch, such as the positioning of fielders, preparation of a relief pitcher, or if the batter should try to bunt. Some managers are well known, have winning teams, and make it to the hall of fame, many others are forgotten by fans. This project will explore the role of the manager on a Major League Baseball team.\n",
