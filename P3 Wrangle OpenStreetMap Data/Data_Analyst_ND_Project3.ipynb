    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this project we perform data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for the Yucatán Peninsula in Central America. We will then import the cleansed data into a MongoDB instance so that it can be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise location which we will use is defined by the following longitude/latitude box. You can visualize this region using the [OSM Export Tool](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=7/20.262/-89.363).\n",

    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "There are two methods for downloading the OSM data used in this project, either manually specifying the OSM data query via an online export tool or running a python script which will download the area specific to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual Online Export ####\n",
    "The precise box of data used for this project is shown above. This creates the following OSM Query: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(node(18.521,-92.670, 23.403,-86.440);<;);out meta;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy and paste this query into the [Overpass API Query Form](http://overpass-api.de/query_form.html) and run `Query`. This will download the OSM data which you should then move to this project's folder. Rename the file to `data.xml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Script ####\n",
    "I created a python script which will download the OSM data specific to this project. This will put the OSM data in a file named data.xml. Run the following command in the project folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python ./download_yucatan_osm_data.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To download a randomized smaller portion of the area, append `--small`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python ./download_yucatan_osm_data.py --small\n",

    "#### Website Verification\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Phone Number Format\n",
    "There are a variety of formats for phone numbers, so I decided to standarize them across all nodes. I created a script ... to show the different phone number formats used in the DB."
