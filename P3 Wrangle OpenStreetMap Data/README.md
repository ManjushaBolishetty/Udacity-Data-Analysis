## P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data: Yucat치n Peninsula

![Image of selected Yucat치n Peninsula area](map.png)

In this project I analyze the OpenStreetMap data of the Yucat치n Peninsula, perform automated data cleaning via python scripts, and import the data into a MongoDB instance which can be used for querying the data. The OpenStreetMap data is relatively sparse in the Yucat치n region, so I chose to work with the larger region to fulfill the minimum data size requirement.

This is my submission for the third project of Udacity's Data Analyst program. All files related to this project are located in this GitHub directory.
