### Instructions for using IPython Notebooks

IPython notebooks are useful environments for mixed python and markdown usage. For more information, visit their website http://ipython.org/notebook.html.

#### Viewing 

Viewing IPython notebooks on GitHub is very easy because GitHub renders the notebook for you. Simply view the .ipynb file on GitHub.

#### Creating and viewing IPython notebooks locally

1. Download and install the python 2.7 version of Anaconda via https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
2. Open a terminal and enter ```ipython notebook```, this will open a notebook navigator. If you are opening an existing .ipynb, add the filename at the end of the command. For example ```ipython notebook Data_Analyst_ND_Project1.ipynb```.
